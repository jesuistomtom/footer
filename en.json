  "introduction_text":"The British art collection of the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Bordeaux, has the honor of presenting its latest exhibition “Absolutely Bizarre”. The opportunity to discover a unique exhibition, alongside masterpieces on exceptional loan from the Louvre Museum, this year's British partner. More than a simple pictorial movement, it is more of an informal association of painters. But mainly landscapers, and amateurs characteristic of the artistic realities of the first half of the 19th century. This exhibition offers the first overall presentation, both in France and in Great Britain, of this unique “Bristol School”.",

  "first_paragraph":"Artists renew a wide variety of genres. By exhibiting the painting of city life and genre scenes, seen through the prism of the social transformations of the time. The artists revisited the landscape through an original form of picturesque views, and finally the fantastic painting was treated with a hitherto unprecedented ambition. From 1800 to 1840, Bristol will be the breeding ground for artistic talents which, for some, will be noticed as far away as London:",

  "third_paragraph":"Ce dernier, qui réalisa un témoignage saisissant des émeutes embrasant Bristol en 1831, sera mis en regard, pour la première fois, d’un célèbre contemporain, William Turner, dont on pourra admirer de puissantes aquarelles représentant l’incendie du Parlement britannique, qui eut lieu trois ans plus tard.",
